regular expression to match the string hello world:

Example Code:
```
    const regex = /hello world/;
```

**Regular expressions** can take flags to modify their behavior. 
For instance, the i flag can be used to make the expression ignore case, causing it to match hello, HELLO, and Hello for the expression /hello/.


Strings have a **.match()** method, which accepts a regular expression as an argument and determines if the string matches that expression.


**.test()** returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the string matches the pattern.


The **alternate sequence** | can be used to match either the text on the left or the text on the right of the |. 
For example, the regular expression **/yes|no/** will match either yes or no.


Arrays have a **.some()** method. 
Like the .filter() method, .some() accepts a callback function which should take an element of the array as the argument. 
The .some() method will return true if the callback function returns true for at least one element in the array.

Here is an example of a .some() method call to check if any element in the array is an uppercase letter.
Example Code:
```
    const arr = ["A", "b", "C"];
    arr.some(letter => letter === letter.toUpperCase());
```


A character class is defined by square brackets, and matches any character within the brackets. 
For example, [aeiou] matches any character in the list aeiou. 
You can also define a range of characters to match using a hyphen. 
For example, [a-z] matches any character from a to z.


The dollar value may be more than one digit. 
To match this, the **+** quantifier can be used - this matches one or more consecutive occurrences. 
For example, the regular expression **/a+/** matches one or more consecutive a characters.


A **capture group** is a way to define a part of the expression that should be captured and saved for later reference. 
You can define a capture group by wrapping a part of your expression in parentheses. 
For example, **/h(i|ey) camper/** would match either hi camper or hey camper, and would capture i or ey in a group.


The **?** quantifier matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group.
For example, the regular expression **/colou?r/** matches both color and colour, because the u is optional.


The **\s character** class matches whitespace, such as spaces, tabs, and new lines. 
The **(*) quantifier** means "match the previous character 0 or more times".


**non-capturing group**
This will allow you to group the characters together without preserving the result.
To create a non-capturing group in a regular expression, you can add ?: after the opening parenthesis of a group. 
For instance, **(?:a|b)** will match either a or b, but it will not capture the result.


To match the beginning of the text, you can use the **^ anchor**. 
This asserts that your pattern match starts at the beginning of the full string.


Like the ^ anchor, you can use the **$ anchor** to match the end of the string.

Example Code:
```
    /^Hello/.test("Hello world"); // true
    /^Hello/.test("Well, Hello world"); // false


    /world$/.test("Hello world"); // true
    /world$/.test("Hello world!"); // false
```
